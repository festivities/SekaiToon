- Please don't bother me for assets.

## Rules
- If you use this shader as is in avatars for VRChat, renders, animations or any form of medium that does not directly modify the shader, I'd appreciate being credited - **you don't have to do it though.**
- If you use this shader as the main reference for your own shader, please give credit where it's due.

## Contributing
Feel free to create a pull request and I'll do my best to get to it ^^

## Disclaimer
This shader isn't meant to be 100% accurate - what I only aim for is to replicate the in-game looks to the best of my ability. Some calculations are exactly how the game does things, some are my own thrown into the mix.

While the shader is developed primarily for datamined assets, this repository does not endorse datamining in any way whatsoever and will never directly provide the assets nor tools in extracting from game files.
